Kaytie's parents have just gone on to an interstate trip for the next 8 days. Kaytie had been planning to sneak Dreambreen into his home for the last few weeks and the day is finally here. Dreambreen reaches around 6pm the day his parents had left and ducks around the cars to ensure that no peeking neighbors spot her. She enters Kaytie's home for the first time. They hug a long time. It's quite cold but together they feel warm.
