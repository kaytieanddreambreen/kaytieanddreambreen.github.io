Dreambreen travels for ~6hrs from her college to Kaytie's hometown to visit him for the first time. Kaytie pretends to his family that he is going on a 100km ride and instead goes to meet Dreambreen in a nearby hotel. Dreambreen arrives and they hug for the first time. This visit also marks a number of firsts for their relationship: the first kiss, the first hug, the first sex, the first nap, etc.


Kaytie returns back to his home after ~5hrs with Dreambreen, and says that he failed the 100km attempt and made it to only ~80kms. He will try again, he is determined, and schedules the next "attempt" for the next day.

Early next day ~5:45 am, he leaves home on his cycle (a Trek hybrid model) and reaches the hotel Dreambreen is staying at within 15 mins of biking hard in the biting cold of January. Dreambreen is already up and studying Pharmacology while waiting for Kaytie. No matter what day, she always studies at least a little. Kaytie and Dreambreen intertwine in the sheets for the next 6 hrs. They take a singular break to replenish their energies at a nearby Taco Bell. Kaytie takes his leave around 1pm but leaves Dreambreen some chocolates he promised her. Dreambreen travels back to her college. Kaytie is somewhat in shock, everything went better than it could've in his best imagination.
